      <p>Our company is founded on integrity, quality service, and efficiency! Kupido Wholesale LLC was founded in mid April, 2007. It all began as a dream; a dream to provide a better lifestyle to small business owners. Karen Ovares being the owner of a retail store herself, and seeing the hardships that arised out of her business, she had a deep desire to not only improve her circumstances, but to help her entrepreneur colleagues. She studied the industry, and was able to identify the many problems the industry as a whole faced, the biggest being the lack of trust between clients and providers. Her integrity, solution oriented attitude, risk taking, and sheer determination gave rise to a new way of doing business. Kupido Wholesale LLC employs a unique, modern approach to doing business, which has resulted in over 10 years of industry leading. Stick around, and find out what makes us unique!   </p>
