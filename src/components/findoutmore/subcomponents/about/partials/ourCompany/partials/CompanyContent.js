      <h2 className="heading">OUR COMPANY</h2>
      <p>Our company is founded on integrity, quality service, and efficiency. Kupido Wholesale LLC was founded in April, 2007. It all began as a dream; a dream to provide a better lifestyle to small business owners. Karen Ovares, the owner of a retail store herself, saw the hardships that came from her business, and she had a deep desire to not only improve her own circumstances, but to help her fellow entrepreneurs. She studied the industry and was able to identify many problems it faced, the biggest being the lack of trust between clients and providers. Her integrity, solution-oriented attitude, and sheer determination gave rise to a new way of doing business. Kupido Wholesale LLC employs a unique, modern approach to doing business, which has resulted in over 10 years of industry leading. Stick around and see for yourself what makes us unique!</p>
